## 💡 Concept

At first I wasn't really sure what I wanted to do for my firework show. Especially what kind of scenery I wanted around the show. Eventually, I came up with the idea to do a full on firework show around a place of interest. As my place of interest, I chose the Eiffel tower. I wanted it to look like the firework would shoot out of the tower and explode somewhere in the air.
